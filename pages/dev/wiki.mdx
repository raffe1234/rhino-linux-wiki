# Tips for Wiki Pages

## Notice Boxes

Notice boxes are an easy way to highlight important information in GitHub Flavored Markdown, using syntax like:
```md
> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

While Nextra does not support notice boxes directly, they provide an analogous feature called Callouts. We have a standard format for how callout boxes should be written.

First, it is necessary to import the component at the top of any page that uses Callouts:
```mdx
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
```

Now, you can use the following templates:
#### Note Box
<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
</Callout>
```

#### Important Box
<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
</Callout>
```

#### Warning Box
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
</Callout>
```

#### Danger Box
<Callout type="error" emoji="⛌">
  **Danger:** Negative potential consequences of an action.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="error" emoji="⛌">
  **Danger:** Negative potential consequences of an action.
</Callout>
```

# Guidelines for Writing on the Rhino Linux Wiki
Best practices for creating and maintaining content on the Rhino Linux wiki.

## 1. Know Your Audience

- **Diverse Skill Levels**: Linux users range from beginners to experts. Write in a way that is accessible to beginners but informative enough for advanced users.
- **Be Neutral**: Avoid unnecessary jargon or assumptions about the reader’s background to ensure neutrality.

## 2. Follow Wiki Standards

- **Check the Style Guide**: Many Linux wikis, such our, have a style guide. Check it to ensure consistency in your writing.
- **Stick to Structure**: Observe how existing pages are structured. Maintaining a uniform appearance makes the wiki easier to navigate.

## 3. Be Clear and Concise

- **Explain Steps Fully**: For example, instead of saying "Edit the config file," say:
  ```bash
  Open /etc/config in a text editor of your choice, such as nano or vim.
- **One Idea Per Section**: Stick to one idea per section to avoid overwhelming the reader.

  ## 4. Provide Examples

- **Tip**: Use real commands and expected outputs. For example:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

- **Tip**: Explain what each command does to enhance understanding.

## 5. Link Generously

- **Note**: Include internal links to related wiki pages (e.g., "See the [Networking Setup Guide](Networking_Setup) for details").
- **Tip**: Use external links to reference trusted sources like official documentation or RFCs.

## 6. Keep It Up-to-Date

- **Warning**: Linux evolves rapidly. Revisit and revise pages regularly. Specify versions where applicable, e.g., "This applies to Rhino 2024.2."

## 7. Use Consistent Formatting

- **Tip**: Follow formatting standards:
  - **Headings**: Use logical hierarchies (`#`, `##`, `###`).
  - **Code Blocks**: Properly format terminal commands, configuration files, or scripts.
  - **Bullet Points**: Use these for lists of options, steps, or pros/cons.

## 8. Encourage Community Collaboration

- **Tip**: Add a "To-Do" section if a page needs updates or expansion. Mark incomplete sections with a note, e.g., "This page is a work in progress—feel free to contribute!"

## 9. Test Everything

- **Warning**: Always run commands and follow steps yourself before publishing. Mistakes in Linux commands can break systems, so double-check every detail.

## 10. Be Friendly and Encouraging

- **Tip**: Use a welcoming tone, especially for beginners. For example:
  "Don’t worry if this seems complex at first—follow along step by step, and you’ll get there!"
